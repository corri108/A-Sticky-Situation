# A-Sticky-Situation
Group project for a Game Development Class

## Multiplayer Fighting Game
Started as an attempt to use Photon Networking to create a networked battle game where the objective is to kill the other players using Sticky Bombs that are dropped at the beginning of each round. To save time, we moved on from the networking portion of the game and made it a local multiplayer game.

## My Contributions
My main contributions to the game include:
- Making a polished looking menu scene.
  - Main Menu where the players can choose to play, see controls, or quit the game
  - About page that shows the controls of the game
  - A character select page where up to 4 people can join in and choose a character to play as
- A simple Pause Menu
- Addding the Final UI to the game scene that shows the players who has the bomb and when their ablility is ready to use.
- Adding the Ghost character's ability that turns them invisible.
- Adding the Thief character's ability to steal the bomb from the holder when the holder is within a certain range.
