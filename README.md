# A-Sticky-Situation
Group project for a Game Development Class

## Multiplayer Fighting Game
Started as an attempt to use Photon Networking to create a networked battle game where the objective is to kill the other players using Sticky Bombs that are dropped at the beginning of each round. To save time, we moved on from the networking portion of the game and made it a local multiplayer game.
